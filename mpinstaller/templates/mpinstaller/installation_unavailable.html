    <p>Before upgrading a production organization, you must first complete a successful upgrade in a sandbox.  This is a best practice and is required for upgrades to reduce the risk of issues in your production organization.  Please go to Setup -> Deploy -> Sandboxes to create a sandbox.  Once you have your sandbox, return to the installer and connect to your sandbox.</p>
    <p>When you have completed a successful upgrade in your sandbox, you will be able to run the upgrade against your production organization.</p>
